# write a README.md file for this Imagine a bouncer at a VIP club. He has a guest list, and if your name isn’t on it — it doesn’t matter how confidently you walk up — you’re not getting in. That’s the exact mindset we need to adopt when building secure software that interacts with file systems. My project, Secure File Reader, applies this same principle to files: unless the file requested lives in a specific, trusted folder, it is denied access — no questions asked. This prevents a common security threat known as a directory traversal attack, where attackers try to sneak into system areas they should never be allowed to reach.

A website is hosted on a server, which is essentially a computer that responds to requests from users through a browser. These websites are built from files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images, all organized in a directory (folder) on the server. Popular web servers like Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS store these files in a specific root directory, such as /var/www/html on Linux systems. When a user visits a website, the server delivers the appropriate file, like index.html, from that directory. Sometimes, websites allow users to request specific files by providing a filename through the URL, for example, [https://example.com/view?file=report.txt](https://example.com/view?file=report.txt). If the server code uses this input directly to access files, it can be vulnerable to a directory traversal attack.
What is a Directory Traversal Attack?
A directory traversal attack occurs when a user inputs a file path with special characters like ../ to break out of the intended folder and access sensitive files. For example, instead of requesting report.txt, someone might input ../../etc/passwd hoping to access system files. If the application doesn’t verify where the file request is really pointing, it could unintentionally hand over critical data. This vulnerability is particularly dangerous because it exploits trust in user input, something that secure applications should always treat cautiously.
Project Logic: What the Secure File Reader Does
The Secure File Reader acts just like our bouncer. It allows access to files only if they belong to a specific, pre-approved directory — let’s call this our “VIP folder.” The program takes a filename provided by the user, calculates its true location using Python’s os.path.abspath() method, and then checks if that resolved path still lies inside the VIP folder. If it does, the file is opened. If not, it’s blocked immediately. Even if someone tries to cheat their way in by typing tricky paths like ../../secret.txt, the bouncer (our logic) catches them at the door and says, “You’re not on the list.”
From websites to banking systems, many applications handle files — whether they’re displaying documents, accessing logs, or pulling configuration data. If someone can manipulate these file paths, they can potentially steal private information, tamper with systems, or break into restricted areas of the server. This project serves as a clear example of how to defend against that threat using secure coding techniques. It’s a simple, real-world demonstration of the idea that security begins with strict boundaries — and just like in a VIP club, no one gets in unless they truly belong.
Code Explanation:
We will be using Python’s built-in os module to work with file paths and directories in a way that's safe and compatible across systems.
import os
2. We will define a safe zone: the only folder where users are allowed to read files from.os.path.abspath() ensures this folder path is fully resolved (e.g., turns "safe_files" into something like C:/Users/YourName/safe_files
BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath("safe_files")
3. Define the function that takes a filename from the user and does several checks before reading it.
Build Full File Path
requested_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, user_input_filename))
Combines the base directory with the filename.
Converts it into a complete file path — resolving any ../ attempts to escap
4. Check for Directory Traversal: If the final path doesn’t start with BASE_DIR, it means someone tried to access files outside it — and we block them!
if not requested_path.startswith(BASE_DIR):
raise Exception("⚠️ Unauthorized access attempt blocked!")
Project: Secure File Reader (Defends Against Directory Traversal)
import os

# Define the base directory where files are allowed

BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath("safe_files")

# Ensure base directory exists

os.makedirs(BASE_DIR, exist_ok=True)

# Function to safely read a file if it's within the allowed directory

def read_file_securely(user_input_filename):
try:
\# Construct the full path from user input
requested_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, user_input_filename))

        # Check if the resolved path starts with the BASE_DIR path
        if not requested_path.startswith(BASE_DIR):
            raise Exception("⚠️ Unauthorized access attempt blocked!")
    
        # Read the file content
        with open(requested_path, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            return content
    
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "❌ File not found."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"❌ Error: {str(e)}"
    
# Example usage

if __name__ == "__main__":
print("📂 Secure File Reader")
filename = input("Enter the filename to read (within 'safe_files/' folder): ")
output = read_file_securely(filename)
print("\n🔎 File Content:\n", output)
Output:

Securing software begins with assuming that every input could be an attack — and that mindset is what the Secure File Reader is built on. Through a simple yet powerful logic, we’ve demonstrated how directory traversal attacks can be blocked by validating and restricting file access to a safe, predefined location. By resolving paths properly and verifying them against a trusted base directory, the Secure File Reader acts as a gatekeeper, protecting your application from unauthorized file access. While the concept might seem basic, it echoes a critical cybersecurity principle: trust nothing, verify everything. Whether you’re building a personal project or an enterprise application, remember — good security isn’t just about firewalls and encryption. Sometimes, it’s about writing thoughtful code that closes the door before an attacker even knocks.

# Secure File Reader: Defending Against Directory Traversal Attacks

Imagine a bouncer at a VIP club with a strict guest list—if your name isn’t on it, you don’t get in, no matter how confidently you walk up. This project, **Secure File Reader**, applies the same principle to file access in software. It only allows reading files located inside a specific, trusted directory (the "VIP folder"). Any attempt to access files outside this directory is immediately blocked, preventing a common security threat called a directory traversal attack.

---

## What is a Directory Traversal Attack?

A directory traversal attack occurs when an attacker tries to access files outside the intended folder by manipulating file path inputs, often using special characters like `../` to move up directories. For example, instead of requesting `report.txt`, an attacker might input `../../etc/passwd` to try accessing sensitive system files.

If an application does not properly verify the true location of requested files, it may unintentionally expose critical data, posing serious security risks.

---

## Project Overview

The Secure File Reader ensures that only files inside a predefined safe directory (`safe_files`) can be accessed. It does this by:

- Defining a **base directory** (`BASE_DIR`) which acts as the trusted "VIP folder".
- Resolving the user-provided filename to an absolute path.
- Verifying that the resolved path starts with the `BASE_DIR` path.
- Blocking any access if the requested file lies outside the safe directory.

This approach effectively stops directory traversal attempts, acting as a vigilant gatekeeper.

---

## How It Works: Code Explanation

```

import os

# Define the safe base directory

BASE_DIR = os.path.abspath("safe_files")

# Ensure base directory exists

os.makedirs(BASE_DIR, exist_ok=True)

def read_file_securely(user_input_filename):
try:
\# Construct the absolute path for the requested file
requested_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, user_input_filename))

        # Check if requested path is inside the trusted base directory
        if not requested_path.startswith(BASE_DIR):
            raise Exception("⚠️ Unauthorized access attempt blocked!")
    
        # Read and return file content
        with open(requested_path, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            return content
    
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "❌ File not found."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"❌ Error: {str(e)}"
    ```

### Example Usage

```

if __name__ == "__main__":
print("📂 Secure File Reader")
filename = input("Enter the filename to read (within 'safe_files/' folder): ")
output = read_file_securely(filename)
print("\n🔎 File Content:\n", output)

```

---

## Why This Matters

Web servers and many applications serve files from a specific directory, and many allow user input to specify which file to read. Without robust checks, attackers can exploit this to access sensitive files anywhere on the system.

This project demonstrates how **strict boundaries and verification** in code prevent such vulnerabilities. By always resolving paths and confirming they lie within an approved directory, you close the door to unauthorized access—a critical security best practice.

---

## Getting Started

1. Create a folder named `safe_files` in your project directory.
2. Place some text files inside this folder for testing.
3. Run the script and input filenames located only within `safe_files`.
4. Attempt to input dangerous paths like `../secret.txt` to see the protection in action.

---

## Summary

- Secure File Reader uses Python’s `os.path.abspath()` to resolve full file paths.
- Verifies that file access requests remain within a trusted base directory.
- Blocks directory traversal attacks by rejecting any requests outside this safe zone.
- Serves as a practical example of secure coding in file system interactions.
